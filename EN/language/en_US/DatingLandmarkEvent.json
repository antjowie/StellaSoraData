  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1401.1": "The carriage turns east into the Academy, the buildings drift past overhead. \"Whoa—\" You lean against the front gate.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1401.2": "You hear ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s heels clicking on the pavement. She stands by the signpost, one hand on the rail.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1401.3": "As the carriage rolls away, a breeze stirs and she waves to you.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1402.1": "It's just after class. The entrance of the teaching building is bustling with students coming and going.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1402.2": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== slip in with the crowd and enter the building.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1402.3": "\"A good school has no walls,\" you think to yourself.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1403.1": "The timing is bad. Everyone's in class, and the doorway is empty. You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== decide to bluff your way in, posing as students.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1403.2": "The guard sizes you both up. Are you really students? Luckily, he doesn't stop you.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1403.3": "==DATING_CHARACTER== says you still look student-ish enough to pass.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1404.1": "Somehow, you and ==DATING_CHARACTER== end up sneaking into a classroom.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1404.2": "It's a dense, technical lecture, the kind you can't make sense of at all. The professor's words blur, the writing on the board looks like another language, and your mind starts to wander...",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1404.3": "\"Ding...\" The bell rings—you wake with a start. Turning head, you find ==DATING_CHARACTER== beside you, stifling a laugh.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1405.1": "You sneak into a math lecture. The professor drones on, and ==DATING_CHARACTER== looks a bit tense.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1405.2": "You notice the professor's methods seem outdated. As you mull it over, your eyes meet. The professor calls on you to summarize the lesson. You offer a more general explanation.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1405.3": "The professor nods approvingly, and ==DATING_CHARACTER== looks at you with admiration.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1406.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== climb the stairs of a tall building, heading straight for the top floor. On a whim, you decide to check out the rooftop.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1406.2": "You climb through the window, grab ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s hand, and pull her up onto the rooftop. The view stretches wide. Far off, the outline of the Monolith shimmers faintly; below, people scurry between buildings like ants.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1406.3": "The sky is a brilliant blue. ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s grip on your hand hurts a little. From up here, everything else feels small.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1407.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== climb to the top floor. The setting sun pours through the rooftop windows, and you decide to climb up.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1407.2": "You climb through the window, grab ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s hand, and pull her up onto the rooftop. Daylight fades across the horizon, the glow expands, your shadows stretching long.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1407.3": "Your breathing melts into the warm twilight air. No words are needed because they feel clumsy in this moment.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1408.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== are drawn to a display board in the square.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1408.2": "It lists the newest academic achievements and projects.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1408.3": "You don't really understand it, but you're sure both you and ==DATING_CHARACTER== are a little more \"educated\" than you were yesterday.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1409.1": "In the plaza stands a small flower arch, and ==DATING_CHARACTER== pulls you over to it.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1409.2": "She's so happy her steps are almost a skip. \"Boss, take a picture of me!\"==DATING_CHARACTER== calls out as she leans back against the flowers.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1409.3": "Sunlight filters through branches, dappling ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s face. The air is thick with the scent of blossoms. Her smile freezes forever in your phone.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1410.1": "\"Excuse me, you two.\" A student stops you and ==DATING_CHARACTER==. \"Would you be interested in joining the debate club?\"",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1410.2": "You think you have the eloquence for it. But sadly, you're not a student here. Regretfully, you decline.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1411.1": "A sharply dressed young man approaches you. \"Good afternoon, I'm with the student council.\" He hands you both flyers. \"We're recruiting. Would you like to learn more?\"",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1411.2": "Endless paperwork and busywork ominously flash through your mind.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1411.3": "\"No thanks,\" you wave him off, ending the talk.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1412.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== spot a group of students gathered on the lawn. Curiosity draws you closer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1412.2": "It's a small jam session. Some students are strumming instruments to accompany a singer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1412.3": "Though the singer and the band seem a bit unpolished, everyone performs with such energy. Maybe that's just the urge to express that comes with youth.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1413.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== spot a group of students gathered on the lawn. Curiosity draws you closer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1413.2": "It's a small jam session. The students look at you. \"Want to sing something? Anything's fine.\" One invites you. Caught up in the mood, you decide to sing a few lines.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1413.3": "Even if your tune is otherworldly, the musicians still manage to uphold its avant-garde spirit. Sitting beside you, ==DATING_CHARACTER== hums softly along with the song.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1418.1": "Inside the Academy shop, you find souvenirs for sale. Why not buy something?",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1418.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== chooses a fountain pen with the school crest and you settle on a folder with a campus scene.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1418.3": "Both of these are practical purchases. You'll think of this afternoon whenever you do paperwork.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1419.1": "Inside the Academy shop, you find souvenirs for sale. Why not buy something?",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1419.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== chooses a school crest and you settle on a cap with the same emblem.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.1419.3": "After leaving the shop, you exchange them, making the mementos even more meaningful.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.501.1": "The entrance of the cave is covered in moss. It looks like nobody has visited here for a long time.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.501.2": "\"What are we going to find today?\" The two of you continue to explore while chatting along the way.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.502.1": "You discover an ancient statue wedged in a crack in the stone wall. It seems like someone deliberately hid it here.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.502.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== thinks the stone statue's face looks a bit like yours.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.503.1": "A bottomless chasm cuts off your path. A smooth, natural ice bridge spans across the gap.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.503.2": "Hand in hand, you and ==DATING_CHARACTER== make it safely across the bridge.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.504.1": "Deep in the cave, a mysterious glow flickers. It's coming from flowers that hang from the stone walls like lanterns.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.504.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== gets on your shoulder and carefully reaches up to pluck a flower.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.505.1": "An underground river quietly flows across the path. In the darkness of the cave, you can't make out the width of the river.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.505.2": "You discover eyeless fish in the river.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.506.1": "You discover a spacious stone chamber. Faint murals can be seen on the walls, suggesting it was once a place for some sort of ritual long ago.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.506.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== lights a campfire, and the two of you rest together against each other's shoulder for a while.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.507.1": "You find a high ground that is dry, lay out a blanket, and decide to take a good rest.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.507.2": "The two of you are tired and quickly fall asleep.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.507.3": "When you open your eyes, you're met with ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s adorable sleeping face.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.508.1": "The air grows hotter. The constant stream of sweat drains what little energy you have left.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.508.2": "The heat is coming from a secret hot spring.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.508.3": "You decide to kick off your shoes and soak your legs in the water.\nThe moment your legs sink into the warm water, all your fatigue vanishes.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.509.1": "In the depth of the cave, there are gigantic black boulders everywhere. They are covered in thick, sturdy vines.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.509.2": "Supporting each other, you climb the vines and make it to the top of the giant rock.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.509.3": "There, stuck into the rock, is a rusted, broken sword.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.510.1": "You step into a cave. Its arched ceiling is studded with sparkling gemstones. From their arrangement, it looks like they're meant to mimic the constellations in the sky.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.510.2": "The thing is... You have never seen these constellations before.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.511.1": "Gleaming specks on the rock wall catch your attention. You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== move closer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.511.2": "They're veins of ore, glowing faintly. But without proper tools, you can't pry them out.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.512.1": "Gleaming specks on the rock wall catch your attention. You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== move closer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.512.2": "They're glowing lichens. You can pluck a few and tuck them into your hair as ornaments.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.513.1": "==DATING_CHARACTER== squeezes through a narrow crack in the rock, with you right behind her.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.513.2": "It really is tight! \"Push me!\" ==DATING_CHARACTER== calls out. You awkwardly give her a shove.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.513.3": "Once ==DATING_CHARACTER== squeezes through, she pulls you out too.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.514.1": "You take a rest in a small cliff crevice that's just big enough for the two of you.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.514.2": "In order to relax better, you and ==DATING_CHARACTER== decide to take turns resting your head in each other's lap.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.514.3": "It actually feels quite nice to have somebody's head in your lap.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.520.1": "Gradually, you feel a draft of cool air coming from the depth.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.520.2": "Following it, you find a faintly glowing exit.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.520.3": "You emerge from the cave through another opening. The adventure has come to its conclusion.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.521.1": "After wandering in circles, you realize you've returned to the very first chamber.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.521.2": "So you end up leaving the cave from the entrance.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.601.1": "You gently push the door open, and the familiar chime of wind bells rings in your ears.\nToday, though, the dessert shop feels a little different from usual.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.601.2": "Like always, ==DATING_CHARACTER== is sitting by the window and waiting for you.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.601.3": "She sees you and waves at you, smiling.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.602.1": "You gently push the door open, and the familiar chime of wind bells rings in your ears.\nToday, though, the dessert shop feels a little different from usual.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.602.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== is standing at the door.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.602.3": "She spots you and immediately walks over with a light, eager step. She looks very excited.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.603.1": "The brownie you ordered arrives at the table, rich with cocoa aroma.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.603.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== cuts it neatly in half.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.603.3": "It's both bitter and sweet. Is this the taste of the South?",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.604.1": "The Opéra cake arrives. You count the layers one by one. There are seven.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.604.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== cuts it neatly in half.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.604.3": "This cake is both delicate and airy, very much refined.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.605.1": "You realize that ==DATING_CHARACTER== is looking at you curiously. She's wondering what's on your mind.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.605.2": "\"It's a secret,\" you say with a teasing smile, shaking your head.\nThis only makes ==DATING_CHARACTER== even more curious, and she offers to trade one of her secrets for yours.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.605.3": "It turns out that while she was waiting for you, she was also reminiscing about the same memory.\nWhich is why she specifically ordered the cake she had during your first meeting.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.606.1": "You realize that ==DATING_CHARACTER== is looking at you curiously. She's wondering what's on your mind.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.606.2": "You shake your head teasingly and point to her face.\nOnly then does ==DATING_CHARACTER== realize that a bit of dessert is stuck at the corner of her mouth.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.606.3": "You hand her a napkin with a smile. She takes it, looking a little shy.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.607.1": "A little girl from the next table runs past you two. She stumbles and almost falls.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.607.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== quickly crouches down to catch the child but brings the tablecloth down in the process... Unfortunately, the drink ends up splashing all over ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s back.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.607.3": "You quickly grab a towel and some cleaner, helping ==DATING_CHARACTER== by carefully wipe down her clothes. She looks a little embarrassed but thanks you sincerely.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.608.1": "A little girl from the next table runs past you two. She stumbles and almost falls.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.608.2": "You react quickly, stepping in to prevent an accident.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== gives you an approving look.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.608.3": "The parents rush over and apologize to you both.\nIt was a close call, but there's no harm done. Both of you breathe a sigh of relief.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.609.1": "The waitress brings two mugs of hot chocolate topped with a swirl of cream.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.609.2": "It's smooth, silky, not too sweet. You could easily order another.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.610.1": "The waitress brings two glasses of iced tea with bits of fruit floating inside.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.610.2": "Floral and fruity notes bloom on your tongue.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.611.1": "\"Can I try yours?\" ==DATING_CHARACTER== asks suddenly.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.611.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== leans over and takes a sip through the straw.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.611.3": "\"I knew it. Yours is sweeter!\"",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.612.1": "Gentle music flows through the sweet-scented air.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.612.2": "As you chat, your spoons occasionally tap against the side of the cup, creating a crisp, melodic sound.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.613.1": "The tension eases and ==DATING_CHARACTER== starts to relax a little.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.613.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== tells you that she's ran into some trouble recently. You listen patiently as ==DATING_CHARACTER== shares her story in detail.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.613.3": "After getting the full story, you give her your thoughts on the matter. ==DATING_CHARACTER== looks thoughtful.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.614.1": "The tension eases and ==DATING_CHARACTER== starts to relax a little.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.614.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== tells you that she's ran into some trouble recently. You listen patiently as ==DATING_CHARACTER== shares her story in detail.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.614.3": "Halfway into her story, you suggest getting some food first. \"You won't work that out on an empty stomach.\"\n==DATING_CHARACTER== grins with relief.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.619.1": "As a thank-you for your hospitality today, ==DATING_CHARACTER== says next time it will be her treat.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.619.2": "So, with great excitement, the two of you start discussing which restaurant to go to...",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.620.1": "As a thank-you for your treat today, ==DATING_CHARACTER== offers to treat you to another meal later today.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.620.2": "You decide to take a rain check on that. After all, you're plenty full today!",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.701.1": "Word has it that today's market is the biggest one in a while.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.701.2": "You agreed to meet at the alleyway's entrance, and you spot ==DATING_CHARACTER== right away.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.702.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== are surrounded by a hundred voices all hawking their wares.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.702.2": "A booming pastry vendor cuts through the noise. You wander over. She's selling pineapple cakes.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.702.3": "After tasting one, you can't resist buying a small bag to share.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.703.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== are surrounded by a hundred voices all hawking their wares.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.703.2": "You follow a faint sweet scent through the crowd. It leads you to a stall selling sugar cakes.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.703.3": "The smell is coming from condensed milk cakes. You buy a bag without hesitation.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.704.1": "Next to it, a flute player is selling \"honey that makes love eternal.\" You are intrigued.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.704.2": "It turns out to be nothing but ordinary syrup, both in quality and in price.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.704.3": "\"Let's just buy one to try,\" ==DATING_CHARACTER== says and takes a jar.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.705.1": "You arrive at a spice stall, its sharp exotic scents forcing their way into your nose, beckoning you closer.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.705.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== crushes a leaf in her hands just to take in the smell.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.705.3": "In the end, you buy a jar of blackcurrants soaked in liquor.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.706.1": "You continue to browse the market.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.706.2": "To your surprise, you realize that even in the crowded chaos, she still slips through with ease, never bumping into anyone.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.706.3": "You, on the other hand, stumble and dodge, your bags constantly brushing against others.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.707.1": "While shopping, ==DATING_CHARACTER== bargains with the merchants.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.707.2": "She wins a few discounts gracefully.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.707.3": "She's not just buying for herself—she buys for you, too.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.708.1": "The array of goods is dazzling to the eye, and there are some Artifacts that you have never seen before.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== stops in front of a small stall.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.708.2": "The stall owner, noticing potential customers, eagerly begins showcasing their goods.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== sets her sights on a small, elegant pocket watch.\nShe pulls you aside and asks for your opinion in a whisper.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.708.3": "You gasp inwardly upon hearing the price.\nYou tell ==DATING_CHARACTER== that you've seen similar designs elsewhere and that this one might be a bit overpriced.\nShe trusts your judgment.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.709.1": "The array of goods is dazzling to the eye, and there are some Artifacts that you have never seen before.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== stops in front of a small stall.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.709.2": "The stall owner, noticing potential customers, eagerly begins showcasing their goods.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== sets her sights on a pretty trinket.\nShe pulls you aside and asks for your opinion in a whisper.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.709.3": "You buy it for her without a second thought. She is overjoyed.\nYou can tell that she really does love it.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.710.1": "A fragrance stall catches ==DATING_CHARACTER=='s attention.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.710.2": "Here they're selling the perfume that's all the rage in Flavio. The vendor gives ==DATING_CHARACTER== a spritz behind her ear.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.710.3": "She says the scent makes her feel like she doesn't even recognize herself.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.711.1": "You pass a flower shop, its mysterious fragrance luring you in.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.711.2": "In the shop, the floral scent grows stronger, blooming in your mind. You decide to buy a bouquet.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.711.3": "\"You're like a freshly blossomed flower.\"\n\"Thank you. I really like it.\"",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.712.1": "Time flies, and it feels like you two have visited every single stall.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== says there are still a few things she wants to check out on her own.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.712.2": "So, you part ways for a little while. With your legs feeling sore, you find a bench to rest on. Before you know it, you've drifted off to sleep.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.712.3": "When you wake, you find ==DATING_CHARACTER== watching your sleeping face intently.\nShe laughs brightly and hands you the snacks she has bought.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.713.1": "Time flies, and it feels like you two have visited every single stall.\n==DATING_CHARACTER== says there are still a few things she wants to check out on her own.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.713.2": "So, you part ways for a little while. With your legs feeling sore, you find a bench to rest on.\nSoon she's back, carrying two servings of mouthwatering snacks.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.713.3": "You happily share a meal of street food together.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.724.1": "==DATING_CHARACTER== takes out a beautifully wrapped gift. She had secretly picked it out earlier at the market.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.724.2": "==DATING_CHARACTER== looks a bit nervous, but you pull out the gift you have just prepared for her.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.724.3": "Caring minds think alike! You are both a little embarrassed but happily exchange your gifts.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.725.1": "==DATING_CHARACTER== takes out a beautifully wrapped gift. She had secretly picked it out earlier at the market.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.725.2": "You open the surprise right then and there. It's a little something you'd mentioned to her a long time ago.\nYou thank ==DATING_CHARACTER== so profusely that she looks very embarrassed.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.725.3": "You almost wish you could rent out the whole street just to walk it with her again—though of course, you know it'll take a lot more work to make that dream real.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.726.1": "==DATING_CHARACTER== takes out a beautifully wrapped gift. She had secretly picked it out earlier at the market.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.726.2": "With an air of mystery, ==DATING_CHARACTER== tells you that you cannot open this present until you get home.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.726.3": "You stick to the agreement and decide to save this surprise for the very end.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.801.1": "As you draw closer to the Port, you can already feel the warm, humid air.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.801.2": "The waves crash against the breakwater as you stand below, looking up.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.801.3": "You spot ==DATING_CHARACTER==, her face turned toward the sun, a wide stretch of blue sky behind her, a calm serenity enveloping her.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.802.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== walk side by side along the creaking pier.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.802.2": "Inside the Port, some boats bob gently along with the tide.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.802.3": "You can't help but wonder: if the chance came, would you set out to sea, too?",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.803.1": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== walk side by side along the creaking pier.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.803.2": "A tall ship is entering the port, its sails furled as haulers slowly pull it forward.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.803.3": "The sailors on deck keep a sharp eye on the distance between ship and posts, shouting loudly from time to time.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.804.1": "Vendors on the pier call out, selling fresh catches of the day. You both wander over to have a look.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.804.2": "The seafood is certainly fresh, but it's not convenient for you to prepare it.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.804.3": "Luckily, they also have oysters. You buy a few, pry them open with a small knife, and squeeze lime juice over them. Both of you eat them as you walk.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.805.1": "A merchant ship is unloading, and a trader eagerly invites you to see the goods he's retailing.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.805.2": "There are all kinds of spices and bolts of silk, but neither of you are interested.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.805.3": "Instead, ==DATING_CHARACTER== spots a few bags of candy. You taste one and find it to be the rare soft and chewy kind. In the end, you each buy a bag.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.806.1": "Tired from walking, you sit down to rest. Just then, the sun begins to sink slowly into the sea.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.806.2": "The water looks as though it's about to boil. The whole world starts to turn gold and the glow spreads across her face. The evening breeze tugs at her clothes. With the rhythm of the tide, you feel happiness welling up inside you.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.806.3": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== stay there together until night falls and the faint lights of fishing boats begin flickering across the water.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.807.1": "A large ship is preparing to leave port. You can make out silhouettes moving on its deck.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.807.2": "The ropes are pulled up, the main sail rises. The huge triangular canvas spreads wide, shining in the sunlight like a white torch.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.807.3": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== stand quietly on the pier posts, watching as the great ship slowly departs.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.808.1": "There is an exhibition ship inside the Port. It's essentially a floating museum, so it must hold some interesting displays.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.808.2": "You cross the narrow gangplank to board. The wooden plank shifts under the tide, making it feel like you could topple into the water at any moment!",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.808.3": "You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== clutch each other tightly and make it aboard safely.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.809.1": "There is an exhibition ship inside the Port. It's essentially a floating museum, so it must hold some interesting displays.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.809.2": "This time you climb up the rope netting at the ship's side. The climb is hard, gravity weighing you down. You can't help wondering if too much time spent lying around in the Monolith has left your body out of shape.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.809.3": "Luckily, being a seasoned Trekker, ==DATING_CHARACTER== reaches the deck and finally hauls you up as well. The two of you sit on the deck catching your breath. You really do need more exercise.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.810.1": "One cabin displays a giant sea chart, but the symbols on it are impossible to read, so you turn your attention to the land instead, studying the locations of various Cities.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.810.2": "\"Boss, are you planning the business expansion map of your 'Accord'?\" ==DATING_CHARACTER== steps up beside you, joining you in surveying this fledgling business empire.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.810.3": "As a fast-growing player-focused vertical startup on the soul domain, it has to identify core pain points, ensure cross-functional alignment, and drive an end-to-end product-development cycle...\nStop right there! Don't let all that jargon get in the way of your time with ==DATING_CHARACTER==.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.811.1": "Another cabin is filled with intricate ship models. If not for the glass display, you'd want to hold them in your hands.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.811.2": "\"Look, look—that ship's design is so strange!\" ==DATING_CHARACTER== points to a longship in the case.",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.811.3": "You recall seeing even stranger ships in the Monolith. Maybe next time you could wish for a little model of your own?",
  "DatingLandmarkEvent.812.1": "The crew's cateen offers a \"sailor's meal\" experience. You and ==DATING_CHARACTER== decide to try it.",
