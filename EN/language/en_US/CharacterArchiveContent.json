  "CharacterArchiveContent.10311.2": "On Amber's birthday,\nshe saved up enough money to treat herself to a cat cafe special in the Emor Ash District.\n\nThat night, Amber had a dream,\nin which she turned into a cat.\n\nAs it turned out, through the eyes of a cat, humans were huge and terrifying creatures.\nThe black cat named Amber tried to control her clumsy limbs as she arched her back, trying to dodge the bustling crowd. Every encounter felt like a brush with death.\nStress made all the fur on her body stand on end. Even if someone did notice this black cat at their feet, they'd probably just mistake her for a stray cat's fur ball—tumbling around the dirty, muddy ground of the Ash District, blown by the winter wind.\n\n\"Chirr, meow. (Come here.)\" \nAmber shook her left ear—after turning into a cat, her hearing had become exceptionally sharp. She pinpointed the cat's call as coming from a pile of abandoned cardboard boxes across the street.\nAll she needed to do was cross the street. Then, perhaps, she would be able to find a companion.\nDespite this, Amber hesitated when she came to the edge of the street. Even though it was only a few human steps away, in the eyes of a cat, the distance seemed impossibly long, like an unbridgeable ravine.\n\nSuddenly, something lifted her up by the scruff of her neck—before she could react, some creature had grabbed her from behind. The powerful gusts from the giants' legs as they walked brushed past her nose, making her whiskers tremble. Amber the cat, who had been flailing her limbs in panic, instantly stopped struggling.\n\"Meow. (Hah.)\"\nA cat's sound came from above, both mocking and comforting at once.\nThe cat who had picked Amber up deftly traversed the street that looked so intimidating to Amber.\n\n\"Meow, purr. (A newbie. Never seen her before.)\"\nSeveral round heads poked out from the shaking cardboard box.\n\"Purr, meow! (Nobody's gonna mess with you, not with us here.)\"\nThe golden head at the bottom meowed twice before a paw pressed it down—a paw which belonged to a purple cat with a tuft of white fur on its forehead.\n\"Meow! Purr... (Don't talk so big, you runt.)\"\nThe cat's words were aimed at her companion, but her narrow pupils were fixed directly on Amber.\n\n\"Meow, meow, purr. (Cat Two, Cat Three, be nice to the newbie.)\"\nThe one who helped Amber finally spoke—she was much larger than the rest of them and seemed to be in charge.\n\"Meow, meow, purr. (I'm not the one in charge here.)\"\nAs if she'd could read Amber's thoughts, the large cat flicked her tail and jumped up to the ruined staircase above the cardboard box.\n...At that moment, Amber realized that even more cats were emerging from the shadows of the stairs, their glowing eyes all fixed on her.",

Join our Cat Kingdom Troupe, and we shall keep you safe.)\"\nShe looked down at Amber from above. Her face and ears bore scars big and small from battles.\n\nTroupe... Such a familiar word. Amber tilted her head but couldn't figure out why.\n\"Meow, meow, purr? (So...the long-haired blue cat who brought me here, is she also from the Cat Kingdom?)\" Amber found herself asking in the same language.\n\"Purr, meow! Purr, meow! (Of course, she's the strongest warrior in our kingdom—Cat One!)\"\nUpon hearing her name, the large blue cat emerged from the group and cheerfully waved her paw at Amber.\n\"Meow. (Then, I'll join.)\"\nAmber answered without hesitation.\n\"Meow, meow meow. (Good. From now on, you can call me Boss Cat.)\"\nAround here, the Cat Kingdom Troupe is a vast underground organization of cats.\nCats Two and Three, who Amber had encountered earlier, were also strays picked up by Cat One and raised in the Cat Kingdom's sanctuary for kittens—that cardboard box in the corner, its official name being the \"Cardboard Cat Castle.\"\nNobody had told Amber these strange details, but they came into her head all the same.\n\nAmber shook her head, clearing away these thoughts, and focused on playing with a magical mouse puppet. This was a daily training routine for the warriors of the Cat Kingdom.\n\"Meow meow, meow. (Don't let your limbs grow rusty.)\"\nBoss Cat would remind her warriors daily:\n\"Purr...meow, meow! Meow! Meow meow! (Soon, we'll face a great battle. We shall liberate our brethren at the cafe!)\"\n\nThat's right. The mission: Liberate the cats inside the cat cafe.\nThis was Amber's first mission after she joined the Cat Kingdom. It also served as a test given to her by Cat One the big blue cat after she applied to join her team.\nCat Two was already on the team, but Amber was determined to not fall behind Cat Three, who only ever thought about games. She swatted her paw against the mouse's tail and watched with satisfaction as her ranking rose above Cat Three's.\nTo her surprise, that single act seemed to change more than just the ranking.\nThe entire training ground began to shake. Above the field, a giant, featureless human face appeared.\n\"Purr! Meow meow, meow! Purr! (No! The humans from the cafe have acted first—we've been discovered!)\"\nBoss Cat's voice came to her from afar.\n\nAmber's eyes flew open, her heart pounding as she glanced up at the sky—\nNo human face.\nAnd she...was not a cat.\nAfter all, Amber knew how cats communicate—with glances, scents, and body language instead of \"talking\" back and forth with meows.\nOnly humans spoke.\n\n\"The Cat Kingdom Troupe, the Cardboard Cat Castle, Cats One, Two, Three, and Boss Cat... Was it all just a dream?\"\nThe starlight had no answer for Amber. She closed her eyes, hoping she'd find out the truth someday.",

Then she pulled Amber away to watch a rare sight—the Shrubshrew migration.\n\n\"It looks like they are made by NGO. Look, the bullets are actually filled with Neo Solution... Oh by the way, whatever you do, don't carry these guns openly in the cities. If someone from the Grace Imperium see them, you'll get fined.\"\nThe girl warned Amber repeatedly with a most grave expression on her face.

If not for the inability to use magic, they could undoubtedly become an excellent sharpshooter.\nBut even the \"Boss,\" who was an expert on Artifacts, wasn't sure if this pair of guns was one of them.\n\nAmber didn't let this get her down.\nBecause she'd already found a clue that will lead her to the truth—\nOn the day she met the newcomer, inside Emor City's Ash District market, she'd spotted a mark that resembled the bullet holes made by her Cat Treat-1911.",

  "CharacterArchiveContent.10811.2": "Only the kids in the reserve force know that Kasimira is very skilled at origami.\nHer members, who aren't as close with her, tend to describe this reserved squad captain as \"repressed.\"\nEven during the Troupe's social events, she is never to be found at the center of action, though one can always spot her standing somewhere not too far away, watching over everyone with a soft smile on her face.\nBut if you try to walk over and talk to her, she would quickly become flustered and tell you to go enjoy yourself.\n\n\"Kasimira... I think she really likes hearing all the gossip,\" said a Troupe member who was working as a makeup artist at the time. \"Last time, Reiran and I were speculating if Nana was having yet another fight with her boyfriend. Captain happened to walk by us and, out of the blue, she said that this time they'd really called it quits. It was scary.\"\n\"All this time we thought she was the kind who didn't care about what went on around her, but she's been paying attention, hasn't she?\"\n\"But for some reason, whenever we try to have a chat with her, she always finds an excuse to wiggle out of it. Kasi can be real sly when it comes to that.\"\n\"Oh, a cat needs to be 'released.' I gotta run. Let's continue this conversation another time.\"\n\nThe troupe is called \"White Cat\" for a reason, because we live alongside a great many cats. Despite a reputation as heartless creatures, after spending enough time with people, cats do learn who always brings them food and whose touch feels best.\nThus, if something happens and one of our member doesn't make it back, the first ones to be informed are their cats.\nThis process is called \"release.\"\nAll White Cat Troupe mercenaries carry a special strap to communicate with their teammates during missions. If someone doesn't return, their teammates are responsible for recovering their weapon and strap, even if these items are no longer usable. Be it a piece of string or a scrap of cloth—they must be brought back.\nBecause the remnants can tell the living the name and identity of the deceased.\n\nThese recovered scraps and fragments are placed together, and the cats are brought nearby. Cats have a keen sense of smell and great intuition, thus they will pick up the strap carrying the scent familiar to their \"cohabiters.\"\nThis tells everyone that someone who once shared a bond with that cat will never return.\nMost of the time, even after confirming their human's death, the cats will return to their normal routines. But sometimes there are a few truly loyal ones who take the straps and run off. They will not return no matter how much they are called.\nMaybe they've gone off to find the owner of that item. Who knows?\n\nCan you imagine it? Someone who fed you just yesterday is now gone forever. You will never see them again.\nCan you imagine it? Someone who was chatting and laughing with you just yesterday will never smile or joke again.\n\nPeople instinctively avoid confronting the hard truths, as if pretending they never happened will make them disappear. Feigning ignorance is a valuable survival skill, and those who excel at it can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain.\nBut many people are not good at it, and Kasimira is one of them.",
  "CharacterArchiveContent.10812.1": "The Journey",
  "CharacterArchiveContent.10812.2": "The children discovered Kasimira's secret after one of the release ceremonies.\nAlthough the reserve kids are allowed to feed the Troupe's cats, they remain barred from attending the release ceremonies. This doesn't bother them, though, because around these irregularly held ceremonies, the adults cannot spare them the attention or the time.\nThis represents a rare chance for them to run wild and play freely.\nOnce, when they had planned to go on an adventure by the stream near the Troupe's base, they found Kasimira sitting by the water. She folded colorful square-shaped papers into beautiful little boats with just a few creases.\n\"If we share some of our candy with you, can we have one of your little boats?\"\n\"You caught me at a bad time. I didn't bring extra paper with me. These boats are for my friends. Ask me next time.\"\n\nFriends? Just where are her friends?\nThe children looked around but didn't see anyone else. Still, they accepted her explanation.\n\"Then next time, we'll come ask you for one! Promise?\"\n\nKasimira simply smiled.\nShe placed the little boats into the water, watching as they floated away.\nOne, two, three, four, five.\nIt just so happened that five troupe members hadn't returned this time.\n\nKasimira is a woman of her word. The following afternoon, she brought a stack of paper to the kids. But this time, instead of folding boats, she made paper cranes.\n\"We don't want Paper cranes. Paper boats can float on water, but paper cranes can't fly!\"\n\"How about this then?\"\nWith a few deft movements, the paper transformed into a delicate paper airplane in her hands.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"According to the Monolith's promotional flyer, an 'autonomous aerodynamic model.' But we usually just call it a paper airplane.\"\nKasimira blew gently on the paper airplane's tip and threw it. It wobbled into the air.\n\"Paper airplanes can fly! Paper airplanes are great!\"\nEach kid received a paper airplane and ran off with the loot. That afternoon, colorful paper airplanes soared under the bright blue sky by the stream.\nBut there was a clumsy one who threw her paper airplane into the river by mistake. She asked Kasimira for a replacement:\n\"Kasi, look, when a paper airplane falls into the river, it floats on the water, too.\nSo it's like, in that moment, it also became a paper boat.\"\n\n\"It's not the same thing,\" said Kasimira. \"A paper boat is a paper boat. A paper airplane is a paper airplane. How can you mix them up?\"\n\"Then what's the difference between them? Kasi, tell me!\"\n\"A paper boat can only drift with the current to a place it doesn't know. Eventually it will sink at an unknown place, never to be remembered again.\nThe journeys of the living and the dead are fundamentally different. The journey of the dead ends in remembrance, closure, and eventually becoming forgotten.\nWhereas paper airplanes—and really, you girls—are meant to soar.\n\nNot to sink slowly into murky waters, but to soar far and high into the vast and clear blue sky.\"\n\"In that case, Kasi, can you fold us birds or butterflies? Those are things that can fly, too!\"\nThis was the only thing Kasimira, as a Watcher, could do for them.\n\"Sure can. Promise me that you will fly far away, just like them.\"\n\n\"I need to do something,\" As she gazed at the brilliant sunset reflected in the water, her hands still folding the papers, Kasimira thought to herself.\n\"I'll talk to the other captains again and keep those reserve kids from going on missions just a bit longer.\"",

  "CharacterArchiveContent.10813.2": "This happened...\nback when Kasimira had just become a mercenary.\nPeople are prone to be forgetful. From misplacing important documents somewhere to leaving heavy weaponry in a random room inside the Monolith, these mistakes can happen with one simple slip up.\nThe most absurd thing Kasimira had ever done was leaving her shotgun outside a magazine shop.\n\n\"Very Lucky.\" That's what the newspaper's daily fortune draw read. Surely something good was bound to happen today!\nThus did Kasimira make the mistake of equating \"Very Lucky\" with \"today is a good day to take on a mission inside the Monolith.\" Until she reached the base of the Monolith, patted her waist, and realized \"Wait a second—where's my shotgun?\"\nThis is bad, this is so, so bad. Not only had she lost the tool of her trade, even more importantly, the shotgun—specially modified by the White Cat Troupe—was more important than her life itself! When veterans retired, their weapons were passed down to the new generation. These weapons carried the knowledge, memories, and skills of their previous owners. Any mercenary aspiring to leave their mark treated their weapon with utmost care, hoping it would become part of their legacy, passed down forever.\n\"You're the most promising rookie of your class, so I'm entrusting my shotgun to you. It's called Catnip-1886. Remember its name and treat it well.\"\nAlthough all the Troupe's weapons were named after cat-related things, Kasimira couldn't figure out why this particular shotgun was called Catnip.\nBut since her predecessor had made a point of this, the name remained.\n\nAnd now, barely one week into her career as a mercenary, the \"most promising rookie\" had no idea where she'd left her shotgun. What a disaster!\nAfter thinking over where she might have left it, Kasimira came to an even more terrible realization:\nThe park, the shopping street, the magazine shop, the snack stall—all of them swarming with civilians.\nJust when she thought things couldn't get any worse!\nWhat if some clueless civilian innocently picked it up?\n\nThere was nothing for it. She had to retrace her steps from that morning and search for the weapon.\nWhile nobody in Mirage would bother to report the White Cat Troupe's weapons as illegal items, inside this chaotic desert city, once something got lost, it stayed that way until you \"buy it back.\"\nKasimira had already prepared for the worst scenario: If she couldn't recover the weapon, she would have to borrow a lot of money from her colleagues, get an advance for several months' worth of pay, and get a new shotgun made.\n\nShe hit the jackpot at the second place she visited.\n\n\"A strange-looking staff? Yeah, I saw it. I didn't put it away, it's on the bench outside.\"\nOn the bench outside? Kasimira replayed the scene outside in her mind. There were a lot of cats playing with each near the door.\n\"Oh... I know what happened. Come with me.\"\nKasimira followed the owner outside and watched as he dug into the pile of cats, eventually pulling out a shotgun.\n\"You know how it is. Cats love playing with things they've never seen before. You left staff here, and for some reason, all the stray cats in the area came running. They really have a thing for it.\"\n\nWhat's going on? Kasimira sat down inside the shop and disassembled the shotgun that was still new to her. She discovered that its magazine was loaded with not bullets but a bundle of slightly withered catnip leaves.\nAh, so that's why it's called \"Catnip.\" Turns out it had this little trick mechanism.\nIt's impossible to know whether this was her predecessor's own preference or some sort of prank. As she sat on the bench, cats climbed all over her in search of the scent. Kasimira didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\nA Very Lucky day, indeed.",

It stood for precision, for rules, for something that would never disappoint.\nAn hour was sixty minutes, and sixty it would always remain.\n\nThat's why Iris also liked doing exam questions.\nEvery question had a definite answer.

It went surprisingly well.\nBefore the climb, Iris did her due diligence.\nShe chose a Monolith close to the city border for the guild, which was perfect for testing the Lucky Oasis.\nThis Monolith had already been visited by many Trekkers, so the Trekker Association had detailed records and guides for it. Given these resources, even newbies could get a good sense of what to expect inside just by reading.\nLast and not least, this Monolith was a good place to wish for Artifacts related to \"office work,\" which were highly valued in the cities and could fetch a hefty price.\n\nWith a solid knowledge as the foundation, the climb proceeded smoothly.\nThe fledging guild proceeded with caution. Iris knew what types of Stellaroid might appear in each room and which corners enemies could be lurking. She devised a strict Soularia usage plan for Noya and Amber.\nWhile other new guilds might throw magic spells at Stellaroid like they were free, Iris would calculate which spells would cost them the least amount of Grace Energy while still getting the job done. After all, they had to pay for these with Dorra at the Grace Imperium.\nThanks to her, the trio managed the feat of clearing three Boss rooms in one go. At the Wishing Box, Iris successfully wished for a valuable Artifact known as the External Brain.\n\nAs the name suggests, this Artifact acts like an extra brain for its user.\nBy typing some magical spells on the keyboard, the Artifact would assist the user in many tasks such as calculation and document filing.\nEven high-level executives in the Gold District took pride in owning such a powerful Artifact.\nNoya suggested keeping the External Brain for Iris to use and Amber agreed.\nDuring the climb, Iris never stopped calculating. By end of the climb, she looking worn out.\nAs Noya put it,\"You should keep it for yourself—if nothing else, your hairline would thank you.\"\n\nIn the end, Iris sold this Artifact.\nCompared to the mental strain of calculation, the New Star Guild's budget posed a bigger threat to her hairline.\nAccording to experienced Trekkers, a Trekker's first wish is always the best, because it carries all their desires or grudges from birth. Once wishing becomes as routine as eating or drinking, it becomes much harder to wish for something truly wonderful.\nIris had to consider what she would do if she couldn't successfully wish for an expensive Artifact next time.\nAs for calculations in battle, paper and pen work just as well. She would just have to work harder.\n\nWith the money from selling the External Brain, Iris returned to the Lucky Oasis to find a gift box waiting for her.\nBoth Noya and Amber had chipped in for this gift—a knockoff of the External Brain called 286 Series Magic Book.\nThough its performance was clearly inferior and the special keys had been replaced with magic runes, the way to use it was the same: It needed to be used horizontally.\nThe night, Iris kept complaining about her guild mates' reckless spending.\nYet many years later, even after the Magic Book's performance had become severely outdated, she still treated it with care and used it daily.",

Perhaps it's because one of the main characters' dreams truly spoke to her.\n\nHere's an excerpt:\n\nFlowers, applause, and dazzling flashes of light.\nOn the stage of the medal award ceremony, Galavera almost teared up from the constant flashes. She glanced at Daria, who was standing next to her, with admiration. Her partner was calmly reciting her speech without skipping a beat.\n\nDaria knew this would happen, so she only assigned Galavera one simple task: stand to the side, keep your back straight, and smile.\n\"Of course, don't just stand there like a statue. Hmm, let me think... I'll leave the end of speech to you. You're great at doing mic drops.\"\nDaria leaned down and smoothed the creases out their dresses, making final adjustments before they went on stage.\n\n\"Shouldn't I prepare a something in advance?\" In her mind's eye, Galavera could see the audience at the ceremony—esteemed board members of the companies and organizations sitting in velvet chairs, potential big clients to the guild.\n\"What if I get carried away and end up saying something like I want to pluck the stars out from the sky up there again? I'm always told to not say far-fetched stuff like that because it makes us look unprofessional, then the big business in the Gold District will want nothing to do with us.\"\n\"But Galavera, this dream of yours sounds so romantic. I really like it.\" Her partner didn't see the problem. \"If the captain asks, just say it was from my draft.\"\n\"I'm not gonna have you get blamed for something I said. Hehe, I already know what I'll say!\"\n\nDaria's speech was finally coming to its conclusion. The memory stopped.\n\"Of course, our goal doesn't stop here,\" Daria smiled as she passed the mic to her partner.\nGalavera straightened her back even more. The flashes were on her again. She held back tears and said loudly, clearly, without the microphone. Even those sitting in the back row could hear her every word.\n\"We will be plucking the stars out from the sky next.\"\n\nThe awkward silence lasted a second before the applause broke out.\nThe company's directors made the gesture of clapping, if only to maintain their usual formal decorum.\nThe award ceremony came to an end.\n\nGalavera let out a happy whistled.

The stones beneath her feet had caught her unaware; she staggered and had to use her sword to steady herself. Daria, who she was carrying on her back, wasn't so lucky. Galavera's stumble had made she slip a little.\nGalavera paused to adjust her stance.

Don't panic.\nGalavera forced herself to stay calm. She felt her partner's heartbeat—weak, slow, hanging on by a thin thread.\nThe wind inside the Monolith carried death's chill, swirling around the two Trekkers.\n\n\"Mm...\"\nA soft groan came from behind her. To Galavera's ears, it sounded like thunder! A sign of life!\n\"Go to the right... There's an Aqua Glopo... You must... stay hydrated...\"\nEven though she could barely string a whole sentence together, Daria was still dutifully guiding her partner's way.\n\n\"You know that no matter how badly I'm injured, I won't die from it! A few weeks of rest and I'll be fine!!\"\nGalavera heard a faint reply by her ear. Daria couldn't keep the pain out from her heavy breathing. \"Mm, but sometimes the body just reacts by itself...\"\n\"Daria, don't fall asleep. Talk to me.\"\n\"Your back is too stiff... No way I can fall asleep...\"\n\"Daria...

It sounded like she was hawking protection charms of some sort.\nShimiao had seen this oddball twice during her routine patrols. Once she was in front of an Artifacts shop, arguing with the shopkeeper that her painting skills were genius level. Another time, she was sitting at a breakfast stall, asking the owner about a kind of bun that was both savory and sweet.\nHer voice was so loud that Shimiao could hear her every word even from the far end of the alley.\n\nThe third encounter was an accident.\nThe strange girl had set up a little table beneath a bridge, with a sheet of white paper scrawled on in ink brushstrokes laid out on top.

I've been looking for you forever!!\"\n\"Eh ... me?\"\nBefore Shimiao could even react, the woman dug into her pack and pulled out a long, cloth-wrapped object. She shoved it into Shimiao's hands.

You're that one from back then!\"\n\"Yes, yes! But I don't have time right now, we'll catch up next time! This is Shimiao's Miaovelous Sword! My Master told me to give it to you! I don't know for sure if you're the right Shimiao... But since the name matches, let's say you are!\"\nShe gave Shimiao no chance to speak. She just said it was a storage tool made by her Master, who had insisted it be given to the right person.\n\"Don't worry, everything my Master makes is great. It'll bring you luck! Bye!\"\nBefore Shimiao could even refuse, Chixia had already packed up and ran off.

Dream Corn has finally bloomed! And it's producing more flowers than all the others!\nSadly, Corn 6 and 7 have died, too... Now Dream Corn is the only one left standing.\n\nCalor Month, 4th——\nDream Corn is thriving and has already started producing ears.\nBut... can it really handle this much weight?\n\nMessis Month, 8th——\nDream Corn's ears have grown ginormous, so heavy that the stalks are bending.\nI hammered in three wooden posts around it, and they're just barely holding the whole thing up.\n\nMessis Month, 22nd——\nDream Corn's ears are so massive that a single ear needs a whole wooden cart to carry it!\n\nMessis Month, 3rd——\nToday Shrubshrew and Boss came by, and Boss suggested we roast the corn.\nBut as soon as we held Dream Corn above the fire, it exploded!\nThankfully no one was hurt, but ... is Dream Corn actually Bomb Corn?",

On the seventh day, the endless downpour burst through the levees, and the murky floodwaters devoured the fields on both sides of the river like a wild beast.\nThen the saturated earth could no longer hold the weight of the mountains—mudslides carrying boulders and splintered trees buried the terraced fields near the highlands completely.\n\nThe disaster statistics for Philae City were cold and merciless: 83% of the plains' farmland wiped out, 62% of mountain fields destroyed, and the city's total grain output cut by 76% in a single season.\n\nHunger arrived faster than anyone expected.\n\nThe city quickly enacted an emergency food rationing system, but the scales of distribution were tipped from the start.\nIn the Gold District, tables were filled with soft white bread and aged wine still; \nin the Silver District, residents could received coarse black bread padded with bran, though in portions half the usual size; \nand in the Ash District, people clutched a handful ration slips, queuing outside United Harvest's grain storehouses for a daily allotment of 200 grams of moldy old rice.\n\n\"Please, just one more piece! My children haven't eaten in two days...\"\n\"Want extra grain? Sure—twelve times the market price, cash only!\"\n\nUnited Harvest's storehouses held three years' worth of reserves, more than enough to see the entire city through the disaster. Yet instead of opening their storehouses for relief, they took the chance to buy up ruined farmland outside the city for pennies, and sell the reserves at staggering markups.\n\nThe gentlemen of the Gold District scoffed at the soaring prices, Silver District families tightened their belts, while those in the Ash District struggled on the edge of hunger and despair. If not for some farmers secretly sharing the food hidden in their cellars with their neighbors, the streets of Ash District would have been littered with countless frozen corpses that winter.\n\nIt was in those days that Ridge developed her fierce obsession with food. She would never forget that single memory: a creaking wooden cart slowly rolling in, piled high with golden, fluffy loaves of bread, steaming with the rich aroma of wheat under the noonday sun.",

It can dig pits, chop wood, serve as a weapon, act as a shield, work as a frying pan, and even fire bombs... In short, there's nothing this shovel can't do.\n\nUnfortunately, production of the 205 prototype was soon halted due to its excessive unit cost.

She said she was heading home to care for her parents, but I know the real reason—she found a new job at the restaurant down the street.\nI didn't want her to go, but business has been so slow lately, and I barely managed to scrape together enough to pay her wages for last month... I feel terrible about it.\nThere are several new chain restaurants opening around town, all under the \"United Harvest\" brand. I sneaked over to check them out, and the lines outside were huge! I saw Aunty Lan and her family there. I can't believe it! She's always been a fan of our sweet lotus root, but now she's heading to those places instead...\n\nI can't tell Mom though, or she'll insist on leaving the hospital.

We'll need to take a more subtle approach.\n\nSigh... Mom figured out. I promised her that the business would be back on track by the time she gets out of the hospital.\nTo help, I've been handing out flyers around the neighborhood to bring in a few customers. I'm also considering running a special promotion. I noticed that those \"United Harvest\" restaurants have membership cards.

But when someone praised his cooking, he was so thrilled and wanted to share his secret recipes with everyone. Thankfully, Weiji stopped him before he could reveal too much.\nMom was right: Grandpa Qin is a chef who takes his work seriously. What he always wants is for every customer to have a satisfying meal.\n\nToday, he came to me and said that he finally understood what the customers wanted and was ready to make some changes.\nI can tell he really wants more people to enjoy his cooking and fall in love with Loong cuisine.\nOnce we close for the night, I'm going to share the good news with Mom!

Even before dawn, she was already hustling, her busy figure moving swiftly from corner to corner.\n\nThere was so much to take care of: preparing the ingredients, cleaning and setting up the dining area... Every little detail had to be perfect.\nThe dough had to rise for just the right amount of time. Not a speck of dust should be found between the tiles. The tables had to be evenly spaced. The couch pillows needed to be fluffed up. All these little details were to ensure the best guest experience.\nNow everything was in place, she allowed herself a quiet sigh of relief, and then carefully placed the freshly cut sunflowers into the tall vase on the counter.\n\nIt was still early spring, with a lingering chill in the air. Droplets of water clung to the sunflower petals, quivering as if they might fall at any moment. Nanoha slipped off her gloves and lightly brushed them, feeling the coolness seep into her fingertips.\nFor a moment, an unsettling sense of familiarity washed over her.\nFor a ninja, \"déjà vu\" was a dangerous feeling. She needed to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from.\nBut for now, she chose to let it go. There were more pressing matters at hand.\n\nAs the morning mist began to lift, Nanoha pushed open the door. The wind and sunlight brushed past her as she flipped the wooden sign from \"Closed\" to \"Open.\"\n\"...Will anyone actually show up?\"\nShe couldn't help but feel a little nervous, as if she was sent back in time, to the very day of her junior ninja exam. She had waited all day, from sunrise to sunset, thinking it was some sort of special patient test. It was only later that she found out the Elite Ninjas who were supposed to be her examiners had been sent on an emergency mission.\n\nShe stood at the door, waiting patiently. Soon, the street began to come alive. The first customer appeared, followed by a second, then a third.\nShe got used to move around the kitchen and dining area, gracefully maneuvering around the food displays and stacks of plates and cups, carrying the warm, mouthwatering aromas. Adults praised her for her attention to detail, and children were drawn to her gentle nature. She cherished every \"see you next time,\"—each one planting a small seed of hope in her heart.\n\nThe sunflowers in the vase were replaced every day, swaying bright yellow petals gently on the clean counter.\nShe tended to them with care, even though their beauty would fade by day's end.\nShe had been waiting for someone...",

In the rare moments of quiet, Nanoha felt an unexpected sense of belonging, as if she were always meant to be here.\nShe wasn't one to ask for much, never daring to dream beyond the basics. But in these peaceful moments, a desire quietly began to stir within her, slowly growing like whipped cream.\n\"If only that day would come...\"\n\n\"Ah!!\"\nA cheering little girl, flailing her arms around, accidentally knocked over her dessert. The melting cherry ice cream spilled everywhere.\n\"It's okay. Let me clean it.\"\nNanoha smiled and calmed the flustered child, then started cleaning up the mess.\n\"Sis, your gloves...they've got some jam on them.\"\nNanoha looked down at her gloves, the white satin now marked with a few dark red stains. A memory suddenly surfaced. Now she understood why she'd felt that strange sense of familiarity when touching the droplets on the sunflower petals earlier.\nEver since her first mission, she'd started wearing gloves. Because she couldn't stand the feel of someone else's blood on her skin.\n \nDing—\nThe wind chime by the door jingled as another customer walked in.\n\"Welcome! How can I-\"\n\"I'll have the special plum wine with agar jelly, please.\"\nThe customer smiled at her. At last, the person she'd been waiting for arrived.\n\nThe night was far from over. In a quiet, unremarkable alley, silence hung thick in the air. Someone would never speak again.\nScattering sunflower petals on the ground had already lost their bright color. A short figure was patiently picking them up, as if performing a final tribute.\n\"Are you going to clean up every petals? You and your master are very much alike in many ways.\"\nA female figure sat on the wall, swinging her legs idly. She held up a special-shaped shuriken to the moonlight, admiring it.\nIt was her first time working with Nanoha, and the quiet, reserved younger ninja was a bit of a mystery to her.\n\"You ever heard? For ninjas, a full moon is a bad omen. Guess we were lucky tonight.\"\n\"Yeah, I had my first mission on the night of the full moon.\"\n\"Really? How did that go?\"\n\nNanoha didn't respond. She carefully picked up the last petal, ensuring no trace was left behind, then turned toward the woman sitting under the moonlight.\n\"Can we go now?\"\n\"Yeah, sure. I'm starving. Let's grab a late-night snack.\"\n\n\"By the way...why don't you just stay and run the shop? I think you'd be better at it than me. This mission has worn me out. I'm ready to retire.\"\n\"...You know the shop is an important contact point to the organization, right? We can't just change the person in charge without permission.\"\n\"Don't be so serious.

Yet in the end, she said nothing more. She got up and left her seat without so much as a backward glance. A servant immediately stepped forward to help her change coats, preparing her for the next meeting.\nFor as long as I could remember, I had only ever seen my mother at such times. She was always hurrying from one meeting to the next, as though her schedule of councils and boardrooms were endless.\nOnly after the sound of her heels faded into the distance did the others at the table finally exhale in relief.\nMy older brother, already lined with wrinkles despite his youth, let out half a sigh, but swallowed the rest when Famia, my older sister, shot him a glare.\nAmong us siblings, Famia was considered the one most likely to inherit our mother's position, though she herself always claimed that I should be the one to take that seat.\nI, however, had no interest in my mother's position.\n\nWhen I had packed the last of my belongings and walked out of the Metonia estate alone, a gaunt-faced man stood waiting by the iron gate.\nHe was my father, a well-known businessman in Nova. Born in the Ash District, he had, through sheer determination and by marrying into the Metonia family, became a man of consequence in Emor's Gold District.\nAll these years, my father had seldom spoken to us. I never knew what he was truly thinking. Only that, unlike my mother who valued results above all else, he cared more about the direction at the start.\nI thought he was about to say something, but he just handed me a book.\n\"The Fundamentals of Grace Energy.\"\nI recognized it at once. It was the birthday gift I had begged my parents for when I was a child. But now, I had turned my back on it.\n\"Since you chose this path for yourself, see it through to the end.\"\nLeaving those words behind, he turned and walked away, just as my mother had.\nRight on cue, the rain began to fall.

In return, these creatures adored her. The fluffy-tailed nut identifiers and the flying singers eagerly guided her along the way.\n \nThe Sun Knight was on a quest to collect the materials needed to awaken the sun.\nShe gathered handfuls of royal poinciana petals, a large basket of marigold buds, and some tasty onions and purple sweet potatoes—everything packed into a big bag.\nBut no, she wasn't planning to wake the sun with a feast!\nShe also collected spider webs, madder roots, and a barrel of tree sap.\nCarefully, she loaded the heavy bag onto the back of her most trusted companion, Lady Firefang, and brought them all back to her secret hideout.\nIn a large pot, the ingredients simmered for hours, turning into precious liquid by the time the piles of firewood disappeared. What had once been a heap of materials was now stored in several small jars.\nThe Sun Knight packed the jars carefully, borrowed a few strands of Lady Firefang's beautiful fur, and made her way toward the \"tower\" in the village.\n \nShe squeezed through the crack in the wall and climbed the steps to the top.\nBelow, Lady Firefang stood, her gaze fixed on the Sun Knight as she ascended.\nThe ritual to awaken the sun began.\nThe magical fluid from the jars was poured onto the tower, painting it with golden and fiery-red hues. As the warm colors spread, the sky seemed to recall its memory. The warm hues also healed the clouds, and sunlight returned to the village.\nBut the remnants of the curse clung to the Sun Knight. No one knew where she went after that.\nAs for when the Sun Knight would return... Well, that's a different story.\n \n\"Big Bo, don't you think the windmill in the village is lovely?\"\n\"It is! But what's that on it? Is that...an orange?\"\n\"It's the sun! The color's faded from the rain.\"\n\"I see, you were working on this the other day.\"\n\"Yeah. The rainy season was so annoying.

No cheers of welcome greeted her, but she was determined to help those in need.\nShe carefully placed five pine nuts—forgotten treasures of the fluffy-tailed nut identifiers—at their door.\nShe gently returned three bird eggs—cherished offspring of the flying singers—to their nest.\nAnd then, she spotted a set of paw prints—no, not just any paw prints—these were the tracks of Lady Firefang!\n\nThe Sun Knight quickened her pace, following the trail deeper into the forest.\nThrough the wind and snow, she saw Lady Firefang up ahead. She was close now—just a few steps away from getting the answer she needed.\nBut as she drew near, a sense of shiver crept over her. The figure before her wasn't Lady Firefang at all—it was a vicious wolf, who looked strikingly similar to her.\nHe wore the disguise of Lady Firefang, hoping to deceive the villagers and break their trust in her.\nJust as the Sun Knight moved to confront him, the biting wind and snow suddenly numbed her limbs.\nAt the critical moment, the real Lady Firefang appeared and engaged in the fight, shielding the Sun Knight behind her.\n\nThe battle soon ended, as the wolf stood no chance against Lady Firefang. But in a final act of desperation, he grabbed Lady Firefang and pulled her down the mountainside with him.\nThe Sun Knight quickly called on the creatures of the forest. They brought spruces, ivy vines, and a large, elastic mushroom.\nTogether, they crafted a sled to ride over the snow.\nWithout hesitation, the Sun Knight jumped onto the sled and sped down the mountain.\n\nIn a quiet cave, she found Lady Firefang, injured but still breathing. \"Hold on, my friend.\" the Sun Knight said gently. She reached into her pouch and pulled out two strange stones.\nClick. Clack. The melodious sounds summoned a fire spirit. It appeared in a flash of flames, offering warmth.\n\"This isn't enough.\" the Sun Knight murmured, draping her enchanted cloak over Lady Firefang to protect her from the cold.\nThe fire spirit danced through the night. Finally, the long, bitter night ended.\n\nSoon after, the sage led the villagers to the cave. When they learned the truth, their concerns were resolved. However, the Sun Knight, still recovering from her illness, became even weaker.\nDetermined to care for her, Lady Firefang began to learn the villagers' ways of living...\n\n\"No matter how many times I see it, I still can't believe Coco can cook!\"\n\"Heh, impressive, isn't it?\"\n\"Yeah.

And stop sticking your head out the window, it's dangerous.\"\n\"I think...I see something strange in the wheat field.\"\n\"There are some strangely tall stalks, and they're moving towards us.\"\n\"Impossible, you must be seeing things...\"\nThe boy leaned out of the window, and as sunlight swept across the wheat field, he saw a girl on the back of a Firefang. In the golden wheat waves, she was waving a flag made of wheat stalks in the air.\n\"Nalan! Ya! Look, I made this really cool wheat flag!\"\n\"When I become the captain of the Scout Squad, I'll carry it with me everywhere!\"\n\"I'll hang it high at the village gate, so you will see it when you come back!\"\nThe Flufla girl could no longer hear her friends' responses as the carriage carried them away.

She nodded.\nBefore the meeting, she wanted to check her makeup, only to discover that her heavy, ornate gown had no pocket to hold a compact mirror. No matter. As a celebrated star, all she needed was her ever-present smile.\nThe meeting went smoothly. Flora secured another film project, a victory for both herself and the company.\nOnce the staff was gone, she went to the bathroom to remove her makeup. The cold water washed away her makeup, erasing the traces of her stage persona. The sound of unfamiliar footsteps drew near.\n\"Miss Flora? Still here? It's been a long day, hasn't it?\"\n\"I'm fine, thank you.

Her agent sat beside her.\n\"What's wrong, my superstar? Still not used to riding in a high-end Artifact car?\"\nFlora offered a tired smile and shook her head, her gaze drifting to the neon-lit cityscape outside the window. It occurred to her that she didn't even like this city.\nAt night, the streets of Flavio were teeming with drunken office workers, underground idols who were rushing to their next part-time jobs with their stage makeups, and art-pursuing talents who were forced to trade everything they had in a bet-on agreement for their long-overdue opportunities.\nEveryone seemed to be caught in a cycle, siphoning joy from each other's struggles.\n\"Stop looking at those losers. Focus on what you have—talent and better access to resources.\"\nFlora stayed silent, her eyes fixed on the view outside. In the blurry background, she caught a glimpse of a familiar red-haired girl, her figure fading into the night.\n\"Ma'am... I think...\"\n\n\"Don't even think about quitting. There's no going back now.\"\n\nSuddenly, the car screeched to a sudden halt. Flora instinctively braced herself, her heart started racing.\nShe looked around in shaken silence, she realized that everyone—both inside and outside the car—was staring directly at her.\nThey were all faceless versions of herself.\n\nKnocks at the door broke the silence, followed by a concerned voice from the other side of the door.\nA cool breeze slipped through the cracked window of the old hotel, sending a chill to the figure hunched at the desk.\nFlora finally woke from the nightmares that felt disturbingly close to reality.\n\"Flora, Are you alright? We are going to the rehearsal for the show booked by the House of Trekkers' Affairs.\"\n\"Ah...yes! Six shows in six consecutive days are just a warm-up for a Magician Maximus.\"\nFlora rubbed her temples to collect her thoughts. She rose up from the chair, placing the unfinished book back on the shelf. Routinely, she put on her performance attire, as if nothing had changed in the past decades.\nBefore leaving, she paused in front of the mirror, summoning the courage to look at her own reflection.\n\nWhen did she first start noticing it?\nThe realization that she barely recognized herself in the mirror.\n\n\"Miss Flora, perhaps we should...postpone the show. Everyone is worried about your health.\"\nNo response. Inside the quite room, only the crying of summer cicadas from afar could be heard.\nAfter a moment, the door creaked open.

Does that mean I've grasped the essence?\"\n\"Aren't you a clever one? When you're older, come find me in Flavio, and I'll teach you properly.\"\n\"I will!

Minutes later, the elderly man reappeared with a grumpy face, tossing a pile of books and materials at her.\nWith another slam of the door, the meeting between Flora and Nova's last magic prop maker came to an abrupt end.\n\nFlora set up a makeshift shelter on a nearby hill, immersing herself in the study of magic props day and night.\nIn later days, she would look back and joke about herself, \"I must've looked like a witch from a picture book back then.\"\n\nFlora was working on a tool designed to control magic power—a small, convenient device, much like a conductor's baton, but capable of channeling the power and coalescing it into a physical form.\nShe sent the idea to Master Garrod, but his response was nothing short of scorn.\n\"For generations, magicians have honed their skills in isolation, trying to control magic with their own hands. Magic props are just tools. What you're trying to do goes against tradition!\"\n\"But sticking to tradition won't revive magic tricks.\"\nFlora replied with a single sentence before she set off to gather the three essential components for her wand: the body, a magical stone, and the core.\nShe didn't need Garrod's approval—a word of advice will be enough to shed the light. Just like her magic performances, interacting with the audience was a mere distraction. What truly mattered was the show itself.\n\nWhen Garrod received Flora's latest letter, he was surprised to learn that she had already gathered the materials for the wand's body and the magic stone, and was still working hard to find the right core.\nHe couldn't imagine how a celebrated star from Flavio city had managed to journey across mountains and valleys in search of magic conducting material that were rare-finds even in the black market.\nLater, the bedridden Garrod, bored and restless, began flipping through old newspapers from a year ago—he found his answer. No matter which one he picked up, the headline was the same: \"Famous Actress Befana Breaks Away with Radiant Promotion, Plans to Go Solo!\"\n\nGarrod froze. Slowly, he reached into his drawer and pulled out a finely crafted wooden box. Inside was a crimson feather, a gift from his old partner, Celine Robert, given to him over a decade ago, right after she made it around the world and back.\nThe feather was said to come from a mysterious creature. Some legends claimed it was a monster, while others described it as a divine beast. In all accounts, however, there was one thing in common: whenever the creature dies, it will reborn through fire.\nGarrod wrote a brief letter to Flora, the last one he would ever send. He told her to use the feather as the core for her wand, and promised to see the debut of the wand once it was done.\n\nBut on the day they were supposed to meet, Garrod never showed up. Instead, Flora was greeted only by a torrential downpour.\nShortly after, Garrod's eldest son arrived to inform Flora that the old man was dying.\nFlora fell silent. She stared out at the storm for a moment and left the showroom. Against the warnings of the others, she began her ascent up the hill. Alone atop the hill, she bowed silently as if acknowledging an invisible audience, and then drew her Phoenix Wand...\n\nDown in the cottage at the foot of the hill, Garrod lay on his deathbed, sustained only by a medical Artifact.\nIn the last minute of his life, he turned his head toward the hill. In the distance, he saw a flickering red light—a flame, just like the first magic trick performed by his partner magician. It was a simple fire trick.\nThe familiar burning flame would take him toward her in the afterlife.\nSurrounded by his family, Garrod passed away.

My colleagues suggested I follow you to keep you safe. But I believe humans are born with two legs for a reason—to walk independently on our own path. I shouldn't be a crutch to you as you take your first steps, and honestly, I don't think you'd be happy if I did.\n\nBeing a courier is a noble calling. You deliver messages across the land, helping people remain connected. I'm proud of the path you've chosen, but what fills me with even more pride is your courage to step into the vast wilderness and explore a world full of new possibilities.\n\nThe skills I taught you will be more than enough for you to handle the challenges in the Wilds, so I'm not worried about your safety. What I do feel is regret. I've missed too many important moments in your life—your childhood, your first day of school, the moment you became a courier. A good father should have been there for all of those moments.\n\nAnd I owe your mother an apology, too. When I was younger, I was so focused on chasing my dreams that I rarely stopped to appreciate the people who supported me. Your mother sacrificed so much for me, and it wasn't until much later that I truly understood what love really meant.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my life was finding this beautiful hill, building a little house for our family, and then having you.\n\nNow that I'm old, I can finally use the time I have left to make up for you two. To say I'm not worried about you would be a lie. But I believe you'll meet people who share your passions. With good friends by your side, there's no challenge you can't overcome.\n\nI've left a gift for you. It is hidden in the ancient ruins beneath the cave where you used to play as a child. Just be careful—there is a clutch of Draklisks residing in the area, so it's best to bring something to draw them away.\n\nWith love,\n\nYour Father\n\nWhen Teresa was going through her old things, she came across the geography book her father had insisted she take with her in her first Trekker trip. She had read it so many times that she never bothered to open it. And inside the book was the letter, left unopened for two years.\n\nNow, Teresa understood the awkward smile on her father's face the night she returned with Gram.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why you need a courier to properly deliver the letter to its right recipient...",

You can't even hold it with your claws.\"\n\nTeresa paused for a moment, making sure she wasn't snatching the belonging of the Draklisk.

Fine, if you want a fight, you've got it.\"\n\nThe Draklisk's claws scraped against the sword, sending sparks flying.\nClearly, the monster cared more about filling its stomach than getting back the piece of metal it used as a pillow.\nHowever, as anyone knows, a hungry monster doesn't stand a chance against someone who was full of vitality after a good meal.\nAnd lucky for Teresa, she'd had a hearty meal prepared by her mom before heading out.\n\nAnd so, the sword earned a new name after a good fight.\nAs Teresa walked out of the ruins, carrying her prize—a perfect Draklisk scale—she had already decided on its name.\n\n\"Sword of Destruction or Draklisk Slayer... Nah, I think 'Gram' suits it better!\"\n\nThen she thought about how she'd tell today's adventure to her mom. She was so focused that she completely missed the fishbone marks she'd left on the trees.\n\n\"Strange... Is this the path I came from?\"\n\"Eh, whatever.

There was no way she could be caught, unless the Imperial Guard flooded the area with overwhelming numbers.\nAnd if they did...she had a backup plan...\n\nTen minutes later.\nA girl in Platinum Academy uniform and glasses walked right past the Imperial Guard's blockade.\nThe knights on duty let her through without even setting eyes on her.\nAfter all, how could a quiet, studious girl who was reading as she walked down the street possibly be one of those vile gang members?\nOnce past the blockade, the girl tucked away her manga and pulled out her phone.\n\"Vollara, did you make it home?\"\n\"Safe and sound, Cap. How is everything there?\"\n\"Shook them off. Meet you at the usual spot.\"\nEnding the brief call, Minova flashed a smile—one that didn't belong to a student in uniform—and headed toward the deeper, darker center of Ash District.\n\nShe rounded corner after corner, took off her shoes, and waded through a stream formed by water dripping under the Waterway.\nFinally, Minova returned to her \"base.\"\nIn the heart of Ash District, beneath the towering Waterway, lies the quietest spot in Emor\n—A colorful little house stood in stark contrast among the unoccupied, dilapidated buildings.\nThe wind vane on the roof creaked in the veering wind.\nIn the soft afternoon sunlight, birds startled awake, flapping their wings toward the sky.\n\nMonths ago, Minova and the Ashwind kids discovered this place.\nThe house was in complete disrepair; the roof and floors were riddled with holes, letting in enough sunlight into the basement for one to read without a lamp during the day.\nDespite its shabby condition, they unanimously decided to turn it into their \"base.\"\nThe open space in front of the house was perfect for practicing skateboarding, and the nearby bridge piers served as shortcuts to the Waterway above.\nThe neighboring abandoned buildings offered free bricks and planks for their refurbishment. As for other thing that don't come free, like books, the members found ways to buy them with their part-time salary.\nToday, the clan went to the harbor to pick up the books, only to be mistaken by the Imperial Guard as smugglers.

One day, they too could have everything that the rich kids took for granted.\n\nThe ceremony ended in a burst of cheers, but the kids didn't leave. Instead, they busied themselves decorating their new home with wildflowers and homemade natural paints.\nMinova's gaze swept over the joyful faces, then turned toward the towering Monolith in the distance.\nAt this time of day, the Monolith in the city casted a huge shadow over their base.\nThat's alright, she thought to herself.\nOne day, she'd take that step and do what most wouldn't even dare imagine.\nSo for now, she needed to gather more strength.",

It would make her feel...defeated.\nFortunately, the space was spacious enough for two—or rather, the girls were both too small and skinny.\nAnyway, the girls sat curled up in the corner, shoulder against shoulder.\n\n\"Looks like you had a fight with someone.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Funny, I did too.\"\n\"Did you win?\"\n\"Yeah, of course.\"\n\"Then I won too.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"I made her hurt worse than I am.

No one would challenge it for the seeds and frozen insects buried beneath the snow.\nBut the white-tail was not happy. It lifted its head toward the falling snow.\nPairs of shapes passed over the white treetops—\nBrown-feathers, flying free, side by side, together.\n\nThe white-tail could not understand the brown-feathers' way of life.\nWhite-tails only gather in pairs in order to hatch their eggs.\nFood was scarce, gathering in groups only meant less for each bird.\nLuckily, the brown-feathers didn't care for the forest. They were only passing through.\nThe white-tail tucked its head under its wing and enjoyed the tranquility of being alone.\n\nBut the sound of wings did not fade.\nCurious, the white-tail followed the sound and found two injured brown-feathers hiding in a thicket.\nTheir feathers were darker, their wings broader.\nBut on this white winter day, they were far too visible—\nunlike the white-tail, who could vanish from its predators' sight simply by keeping still in the snow.\nThe brown-feathers struggled to build a nest from dead branches that were covert enough for both of them, but with their wings broken, they couldn't reach far for materials.\nThe white-tail slipped away; after all, its path was different from theirs.\nStill, in the days that followed, whenever it passed by, it would drop a twig or two without thinking.\n\nThis year's blizzard was the fiercest the white-tail had ever seen.\nThough used to flying through wind and snow, at last it lost its way, its wings frostbitten.\nAs the white-tail closed its eyes, it thought of the two brown-feathers, and wondered if their nest could weather the storm.\nBy the time the white-tail opened its eyes again,\nit had its answer.\nThe white-tail found itself inside a nest—set up inside the thicket, big enough for three birds. The two brown-feathers' wounds had nearly healed. They had put the white-tail in the middle of the nest, shielding it from the icy storm.\nFrom the look of it, the nest had been built from the start with room for more than themselves.\n\nYears later, a human girl asked the forest birds: why do two kinds of birds with different habits spend the winter together in Philae?\nThe young white-tail and the brown-feathers told her this story.\nThe human girl tilted her head, lost in thought.",

We might not get the best spot for watching the meteor shower.\"\nThere was someone behind Fuyuka—another classmate. The two girls walked off together, laughing as they headed toward the school.\nFuyuka quietly pulled back the hand she had half raised and sat back down on the swing.\n\"Good thing I didn't say anything... Haha, hahaha.\"\nThe cold wind scattered leaves at her feet. Only the swing creaked in reply.\n\n\"Are you lonely, miss~?\"\nA raspy voice suddenly came from behind.\nAn old woman stood there with a crystal ball in her hands.\n\"Hehehe... Do you want to alter your destiny?\"\nFuyuka nodded quickly.\nBut the woman didn't go on. She only repeated herself.\n\"Hehehe... do you want to alter your destiny? Destiny will give hints to those who truly want it.\"\nShe put emphasis on the words \"truly want it.\"\n\nFuyuka understood; she pulled some money from her wallet to show that yes, she truly wanted it.\nThe old woman rubbed the crystal ball theatrically.\n\"The direction where the meteors fall—that is your future.\"\n\"Meteors?\"\nFuyuka looked up. The shower streaked across the sky, falling in every direction.\n\"So... Which direction is it really?\"\nShe tried to make some more sense out of the fortune reading, but before she knew it, the old woman had already disappeared.\n\"Hmm...

Of course it's a person talking!\"\n\nA girl covered in tools was pinned beneath a fallen tree, looking quite miserable.\nHer tools were all tangled up in the branches, and there was no way she could free herself on her own.\n\n\"I—I see, I'll get you out of there right away.\"\n\nFuyuka lifted the trunk and pulled the girl free.\n\n\"Wow! You lifted that tree with just one hand!\"\n\nThe girl held Fuyuka's hand as if she had just drawn a rare Artifact from a wishing ritual.\nFuyuka was never good at dealing with people, and now she was even more nervous. She trembled like a frightened little rabbit, trying to pull her hand back.\n\n\"Then ... Could you try this for me?\"\n\nThe girl dug out a pair of smoke-belching metal gauntlets from the roots of the tree.\n\n\"These are my newest creation. They're kind of big, hehe.\nActually, they're also pretty heavy. I just tried them myself, but my grip strength wasn't up for the job, and I ended up smashing a tree.\"\n\nAfter some quick adjustments, the girl cheerfully slipped the gauntlets onto Fuyuka's hands despite her obvious confusion.\n\n\"Just throw a punch. Think of it as helping me test them. I'll pay you.\"\n\"O-okay... But please stand back, far back...\"\n\nFuyuka threw a serious punch upwards into the air.\nA fierce shockwave blasted through the air.\nWhen the heat wave finally faded, the girl peeked out from behind a tree, with a strand of singed hair around her face.\n\n\"Hey—are you, are you alright!?\"\n\"I'm fine... and so is this little one. The gust from your punch just knocked it out of the tree.\"\n\nFuyuka opened her hand. It held a bird's egg, still perfectly intact.\n\n\"In-incredible. You can control these gauntlets' power with so much precision.\"\n\nThe girl's jaw dropped in amazement. Over Fuyuka's protests, she insisted on giving the gauntlets to her.\n\n\"Weapons belong in the hands of those who can master them.\"\n\nAfter thanking her repeatedly, Fuyuka carefully cradled the gauntlets and set off for home.\nMeanwhile, the girl glanced at the data device in her hand—it was sputtering black smoke from overload. She gave a wry smile and pulled out her phone.\n\n\"Suspend Project Titan-Hand for now. Our design works, but it takes a very particular kind of person to use it.\nWhat?

Full of excitement, never a dull moment?\n\nPerhaps that's why people have invented countless ways to pass the time, with the most universal and enduring one being gossip.\nCity folks and Trekkers in the Cities and the Wilds, men and women, young and old—are always gossiping—exchanging information, forging bonds, and injecting a bit of fun into an otherwise uneventful day.\nBut when the rumors become outrageous, unfounded tall tales—especially ones about you—things quickly become less entertaining.\n\"Give her a photo, and she'll spin a story out of thin air.\"\"From the rise and fall of cities to a local shrubshrew's first handstand, she knows everything.\"\"That's right, she's the legend of Scarlet Sights Media: Mistique.\"\nMistique had no idea how things got to this point.\nWhen she left Flavio, she was just an unremarkable novice witch.\nBut when she returned after some time spent in Emor and Philae, urban legends about her were zipping around faster than her broomstick.\nIn those urban legends, she became the pillar of Scarlet Sights Media, a witch without equal, Nova's once and future best!\n\nThat's a bit...over the top.\n\nMistique once read a line scribbled on a wall in the Monolith: The author is dead.\n—It means what you wish to convey is almost never the same as what others interpret.

These differences are probably bigger than that between a person and a banana.\nFor this reason, Mistique cares nothing about these whimsical stories.\nShe is open to opinions, praise or criticism alike.

Casual gossip is one thing, baseless slander and malicious flattery, however, are another matter entirely.\nBut truth to be told, it's easier to track down the culprits behind a crime than trace the origin of a gossip.

She would tremulously peek out from a tiny gap and watch for the strange and mysterious things of the night.\n\n\"Your little one has such bright, clear eyes.\"\nA wandering Xuan Shi had just returned from her travels and was passing through a village when a rowdy child ran straight into her.\nThe tiny girl fell backward onto the ground and looked up with big, watery eyes. She locked gazes with the Xuan Shi and immediately burst into tears.\n\"There's a monster!!\"\nShe ran home crying, face smeared like a tear-streaked kitten. To this day, her master still teases her about that first meeting.\nMaybe because she was too young at the time, Chixia remembers none of it.\nAnd she refuses to believe it. \"No way I was that scared!

She happily rolled it up and pulled out a fresh sheet of paper to start anew.\n\"Huh? Where's my brush? Wasn't it here just a second ago??\"\nOne day, after she managed to lose a total of eight brushes in a single day, her master's most frequent line became:\n\"How is it that you lost your brush again?\"\n\n\"If you're always this scatterbrained, what will you do if you lose your brush out in the Wilds or during a Monolith trek? How will you fight then?\"\nChixia got the lecture again today.\nShe pouted, wanting to argue, but she knew her master was right.\nHer Xuan skills weren't the best. Despite being in tune with fire, her fireballs are never quite right. They either fizzle out mid-air or they get too big and nearly exploded in her face.\nBut she is good at drawing talismans! As long as she has a brush in hand, even her biggest blunders could be fixed in no time!\n\"If only there was a way to make the brush easier to spot... Then I'd stop losing it!\"\nShe mutters to herself while sitting on the temple steps, only to yelp the next moment when a loose notebook whacks her on the head.\n\"Oww!

I mean, if the brush were th~~is big, there's no way I'd lose it!\" Chixia holds out her arms dramatically, only to quickly shrink back under her master's cold stare. \"I, I was just babbling... I've been reflecting really seriously on your teachings today, master...\"\nHer master gives her a wordless sidelong glance.\nA few days later, as the sun begins to set, Chixia is summoned to the courtyard. There, her master hands her a brush that's nearly as tall as she is.\n\n\"Wh—what's this?!\"\n\"Didn't you say you'd stop losing your brush if it was big enough?\" her master gives her a look. \"The other end's got a support module. With it, you should be able to properly use your fire spells.\"\n\"Master...\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You're the bestest master ever!\"\n\"...Cut the flattery. Give your new weapon a proper name and bring it to the temple tomorrow. I'll teach you how to use it.\"\n\"Name it?

The other girls told Cosette that there was a big plan in the works and it could change the future for all Bayans.\n—A chance to bring a better life to everyone.\nWhat would a better life look like? The girls chatter excitedly about their dreams for the future: proper homes, a warm and cozy room with hearty meals in the cold winter. They've heard of something called cake—soft, sweet, and fragrant—and they wonder what it would be like to taste even a single bite...\nCosette trails in the line behind Aeloria, glancing curiously around. She isn't really interested in what the others are talking about. She doesn't feel much sense of belonging to Nocturn Eterna. What she cares about is Aeloria's mission, and whether there's something she can do to help.\n\nTo Cosette, the people of Nocturn Eterna aren't much different from those of her old village.\nUnder the guise of taking in orphans, they brought Cosette and a dozen other children away, promising food, shelter, even education. In reality, they shut the children in a cramped room, giving them just enough to stay alive, with no freedom of movement, let alone \"education.\"\nCosette spent an entire winter in that tiny room. After that, people began to show up, taking away children one by one. In the end, only Cosette remained.\nThe guards didn't bother to hide their chatter: children deemed useless would be sent back to their villages. Cosette overheard them but thought going back didn't sound so bad. At least there, she could still rummage freely through the trash piles.\n\nAnd it was on that very day that Aeloria appeared.\nShe took Cosette in, gave her food and clothing, a place to stay, meals that filled her belly. She even taught her to read and how to use magic.\nThus when Aeloria received a new mission, Cosette looked up at her, full with expectation.\n\"Is there anything I can do to help? No matter what it is, I'll give it my all!\"\nAeloria's expression grew complicated, and in the end she sighed.\n\"Then come with me to the continent of Nova. As a Sleeper, you'll blend into Novian society and remain hidden until I summon you.\" \n\"But before that, you must learn the magic that conceals your horns.\"\nCosette's eyes gleamed with confidence.\n\"I'll succeed for sure, Lady Aeloria!\"\n\nThe journey from Baya to Nova is a blur in Cosette's memory—perhaps from excitement, perhaps from nervousness. By the time she comes to her senses, her group of Sleepers has already scaled a cliffside waterfall and reached a dense forest.\nStanding on this land, Cosette sees green stretching in every direction, all of it brimming with life. The breeze stirs, insects and birds sing together—a sight and sound unknown in Baya.\nShe turns back to glance at the waterfall behind her, its torrents leaping into the unseen depths below.\nSo this is what Nova's world is like.\nCosette lingers quietly for a while, then she shoulders her backpack. With a map in hand and her mission ahead, she steps forward into an entirely new adventure.",

  "CharacterArchiveContent.14213.2": "\"So hungry... Will I be able to find food today?\" she thought.\nIn the night sky, a full moon hanging high, casting silver light over the ruined village. There was little sign of life in sight.\n\"Days ago, a house on the back side of the village collapsed.\"\nCosette, light-headed from hunger, vaguely remembered a group of beggars talking about it earlier that day. She thought about it briefly: there might still be food left in the building. Maybe she could find something within the ruins...\nThus she gathered her energy and headed toward the north of the village.\nUnfortunately, her hope was quickly dashed. It was a small village, and by the time Cosette arrived at the collapsed house, it had already been thoroughly searched. Forget food—even corpses might have already been cleared away.\nShe sighed, sat down by the crumbled walls, letting out another long, heavy sigh. She hadn't found anything to eat in the last two days. A loud growl from her belly echoed in the silence of the night.\n\n\"Hey, are you hungry?\"\nA lively voice came from behind her. Cosette quickly lifted her head to find another dirty, scruffy girl perched on a half-broken wall, staring down at her.\n\"Your stomach's growling so loud. If you're that hungry... Here, take this.\"\nThe girl rummaged through her equally filthy pack and pulls out two flatbreads, handing them to Cosette. They were dry and hard, no telling how long they've been kept.\nCosette froze for a second. Then instinct took over because survival came first. She devoured one of the flatbreads in just a few bites, nearly choking on the rock-hard crust.\nThe girl laughed at the sight of her scarfing everything down, then handed her a water bag. Seeing how young Cosette was, she eventually gave her two more small bread rolls.\n\"Keep them. This village is almost deserted. Before you go hungry again, you'd better move on.\"\n\"If I take your food... What about you?\"\n\"I'll meet up with my partner before dawn, so don't worry about me... Don't look at me like that. I can't take you with me. We're about to do something dangerous. Might even die.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nThe girl pointed up at the sky. The moonlight bathed her in a shimmering glow.\n\"They say in the sky there's a paradise, with clean water and endless food. If we can find it, maybe we'll never have to starve again.\"\n\"But how could people ever reach the sky?\"\nThe girl didn't answer. When she left, she told Cosette that she hoped someday Cosette could leave this wretched place behind.\n\nThe encounter with the girl was but a brief interlude in Cosette's life. Cosette's good fortune did not last.\nShe didn't manage to leave the decaying village before the next hunger struck. And the next day, her bread rolls were taken by other hungry kids in the village.\nIn a place like this, there were all too many orphans like her.\n\n\"If... if I couldn't even hold onto the kindness that others showed me, then how could I ever repay them...?\"\nThe setting sun stretched her shadow long and crooked across the trash piles.\nAt that moment, she spotted a metal object half-buried under garbage bags. She stared at it for a long time before finally dragging it out with effort.\n—It was a steel claw.\nToo large and too heavy for the girl as she was then. Yet, as if guided by fate, she wiped the grime away. In the last light of sunset, she dragged it with both hands and walked out of the dump.\nIf she had a weapon—if she had strength—then one day...",

  "CharacterArchiveContent.14712.2": "Back when Caramel was a little girl, her father often told her the story of \"Midas the Long-Eared.\"\n\nThe tale perhaps had its origin in a former patrician of Flavio—a man who controlled more than half the city's wealth and manpower, and to whom no one dared say \"no.\"\nA professional flatterer named Midas spent his days and nights praising the patrician's taste. Naturally, he was handsomely rewarded for it.\nWhen the patrician became interested in music, Midas followed suit, never ceasing his praise. Over time, the patrician came to believe he was the finest musician in all the land.\nAs the legend has it, one day, while inspecting a new woodland on the outskirts of the city, the patrician heard the voice of a mountain spirit calling to him. The spirit appeared in human form and said: \"I've heard you are the most skilled musician. Would you care for a contest?\"\nDrunk on Midas's flattery, the patrician gladly accepted. He spared no expense and hosted a lavish banquet in the woods, inviting all of the city's elite. Before everyone's eyes, he picked up his best instrument - the flute - and began to play. As the melody echoed in the air, Midas danced beside him with glee, shouting to his loudest: \"What magnificent music! What magnificent music! You are the finest musician in the world!\"\nAt that moment, the mountain spirit descended like mist. People say that with a mere gesture, he turned a tree branch into a harp's frame and leaves into strings, then he began to play. The sound was like flowing water, like a bird's song, like a breeze, like the moonlight. All those present were awestruck—even the prideful patrician acknowledge the spirit's supreme skill.\nBut just as the award ceremony was about to end the competition on a note of harmony and goodwill, Midas's voice cut through and ruined the moment. He shouted: \"What's wrong with your ears? What's wrong with your judgement? Are you just scared of the mountain spirit's authority? Was the patrician's music not beautiful?\nThe mountain spirit was annoyed and gave a cold laugh. \"Midas,\" he said, \"do not comment on the things you understand nothing about.\"\nThen he raised his hand and Midas's ears suddenly stretched longer than his two arms!\n\"Maybe now you'll hear things more clearly,\" the spirit mocked and vanished like smoke.\nPoor Midas was left with ears longer than anyone else's. And indeed, he did hear more clearly. From that day on, he never praised the patrician's playing again. Instead, he often pointed out its flaws—and rather than punishing him, the patrician rewarded him even more handsomely.\n\"Thank you, Midas,\" the patrician said. \"Thanks to you, I've learned that there's always someone better, always something greater...and that above all, one must speak the truth—especially when it comes to art.\"\n\n\"Is that why our ears are so long, papa?\"\n\"Oh, no, child. But we should learn from Midas the Long-Eared... Especially now, in Flavio, where one's ability to tell the truth matters more than ever.\"\n\"But... Aren't they telling the truth now?\"\nIt might be a long time before Caramel can get this question answered.trings in the Pot",

  "CharacterArchiveContent.14713.2": "Flavio wasn't always the city it is today. It was once a place famous for its craftsmanship and spice.\nAfter a new spice source was discovered in the northern forests, the city-state lord hired many workers to help with spice harvesting and transportation. Caramel's parents were among those who joined the rush. As Flufla, they had sharp senses of smell and hearing.\nMore and more people gathered in Flavio, but each's share of the profit pie kept shrinking. Caramel's parents soon turned their eyes to the Monolith—the rapid growth of the city-state, the booming spice trade, and the rise of Scarlet Sights Media presented a prime opportunity for commerce and entertainment to flourish, and the subsequent demand for Artifacts meant that a wave of \"Trekker fever\" would follow.\nAfter becoming Trekkers, Caramel's parents were able to build a stable home life. Then, on Flavio Day of Nebula Month, Caramel was born. She grew up alongside Flavio's expansion, shaped by the influence of her Trekker parents.\nWhen Caramel secretly followed her parents into the Monolith for the first time, she was instantly drawn in by the Monolith's strange, dreamlike sounds. Drumbeats and deep, piercing rhythms flowed into her keen ears from the empty air overhead, the ground beneath her, and every corner around her.\nOne day, after stumbling across a Stella Drama inside the Monolith, Caramel recognized it at last: the deep, entrancing sound that had fascinated her was coming from the instrument held by the person on the screen—an instrument with four thick strings.\nEven so, at the time, she still didn't know what the instrument was called—it looked a little like a guitar, but the sound was far deeper.\nYears later, standing as an established Trekker before the Wishing Box, she could only dig through her hazy memories of those sounds and images, then putting the wish finally into words:\n\"I want to play the sound of the Monolith.\"\nWhen she left the Monolith that day, Caramel was cradling her beloved instrument in her arms. Looking down at it, she remembered a story her father had told her not long ago. She decided she would become a musician who always \"tell the truth.\"\n\"I'll call you Midas.\"",

I've been so lucky lately, I'm almost sick of all-fish feasts.\"\n\nSo, what exactly is in an all-fish feast? Sashimi? Steamed, braised, sweet-and-sour fish fillets? Fish balls? Fish head tofu soup?\nLaru just grins at the guesses and says nothing.\n\nToday's another big haul. She struts down the street with an eight-pound fish, bragging to anyone who'll listen, including the horse standing by the road and the dog dozing at the shop door.\nShe hums all the way home. \"Another all-fish feast coming right up.\"\nWhen she gets home, she builds a fire in her backyard with practiced ease. The knife dances in her hands—guts out, scales off, the fish split open and set on a rack like a flying carpet spread wide above the flames.\nShe sprinkles sea salt over the sizzling, golden skin.\n\nBut tonight, no one's around to share the haul. The smell of grilled fish drifts into the night air, luring a stray cat to perch on the wall, drooling.\nLaru generously tears off a chunk of tail and offers it to the kitten.\n\"An all-fish feast just means a feast made entirely of fish, isn't it?\"\n\nShe sits down to enjoy her hard-earned dinner, only to see the cat sniff the fish, paw at it twice, and then walk away.\n\"Huh?! What's gotten into you, you little furball?! Wasting food is a crime!\"\nBut the cat doesn't look back. Clearly, it's decided there's nothing edible here.\n\"Rude... You don't know good food when it's shoved right in front of you. This is Laru's personally caught, personally cooked grilled fish! Fine, more for me... mm—mmph?! Ptui!\"\n\nLaru spits it out, her eyes suddenly widening. She grabs her chopsticks and pokes at the fish's head.\n\"I can't believe I forgot to check... This is a Stinkyfish? You can't eat this!\"",

She beat everyone. Her teachers praised her, her parents were proud of her, and everyone around her said she was amazing.\nBut before she even had a chance to feel proud, everyone said the same thing.\n—You'll definitely do even better next time, right?\n—You're so smart, you'll grow up to be someone really impressive, right?\n—These mistakes were just from carelessness. If you focus a bit more, a perfect score is totally within reach, right?\n...\n...\n\nBut I already got first place! Shouldn't you be proud of me?\nShe envied the neighbor girl, who barely scraped by with passing grades but whose parents praised her without hesitation, as if just passing was already something to celebrate.\nWhy?\nLittle Laru didn't understand. She just felt wronged.\n\nLater, as she got older, Laru began to understand.\nShe was too good.\nHer achievements weren't just her own. Her parents, her teachers, everyone around her—they all had a stake in them.\nAnd so, every \"next time\" came with expectation—an endless string of \"next times\" to keep the spotlight burning.\nBut that was exhausting, wasn't it?\nTwelve-year-old Laru leaned against the windowsill. She watched the neighbor girl—her same age—skip out the door, clearly headed off for a picnic with friends.\n\"Must be nice. Just barely pass and never have to deal with anyone's expectations...\"\nThen it hit her. Laru found the perfect solution.\nWhat if she always just barely passed...?\nIf she stayed average, kept her head down, wasn't too good—maybe she could be carefree like that girl too.\nAnd so, at age twelve, Laru discovered her life philosophy.\n\n\"Hello—Ma'am, yes, it's me, Laru. Oh, you said I left early? Actually...I had to meet with a very important client tonight.\n\"Yes, a very important one. They insisted, so I had no choice but to attend... Y-yes, it's all wrapped up now, I'm heading back to the office.\"\nLaru hangs up. The angler next to her shakes their head.\n\"Looks like your slacking time's up.\"\n\"Well, I caught plenty today. Here, take the bucket~\"\nLaru stretches and cheerfully hands over all the fish she caught, then begins packing up.\nThe evening breeze is crisp. She does the math in her head as she walks back.\nAn hour and a half left till the end of the workday. The trip back takes twenty minutes. Today's tasks will take about forty. That still leaves a good thirty minutes to slack off.\n\"Another day, perfectly optimized for slacking~♪\"",

Even if you hate yours, you still have to carry it around.\nWhen Laru first joined Grace Imperium, she immediately picked this lance from the limited options available.

Yet even after all this, she still didn't want to go home. \nShe knew it was late, but what was the point of going home? The house was small, but it was always so empty. All week her grandmother had been leaving at dawn and returning late. Right after preparing Shia's meals for the day, she would rush out the door. \nEveryone said her grandmother was the greatest seafaring Trekker in town, but Shia sometimes could find little comfort in that. All the other kids had family doting on them; she only had the sea for a companion. \n\"Anyway, even if I go home late, Grandma won't notice. No matter how late I am, she won't get in until even later.\"\nA defiant Shia decided she wouldn't return until her grandmother came to find her by the shore. She was both eager and uneasy, excited but afraid—would Grandma scold her? Would she be grounded for days? Whatever it was, it had to be better than the silence. \n\nThe night wind stung her eyelids and drowsiness washed over her like the tide. She wandered for a while, then plopped down beneath a giant coconut tree. \nWhen she woke again, dawn was breaking. She rubbed her eyes—she had slept there all night. \nBut Grandma hadn't come home? Before she could get properly angry, she detected the delicious smell of grilled fish. Not far away, someone had set up a small fire and grill; following the scent, Shia saw that familiar figure. \n\"You're up? Go back and wash up. We'll be having breakfast here, by the sea.\"\nShia ate with a knot in her chest. Grandma never asked why she had stayed out, and Shia had no idea when she had found her.\nBut in the week that followed, Grandma didn't set out to sea again.

Instead, her grandma treated her the same as always and even bought her a new surfboard.\nMore than once, Shia stared at her grandmother's back, wanting to ask what was she really thinking. But it felt like some stubborn contest, and whoever spoke first would lose.\n\n\"But my mom said that your grandma was fixing ships last week. There were some stuff only she could do.\"\n\"You mean the ships that are sailing tomorrow? Our inn's packed with out-of-town Trekkers.\"\n\"My sister's going, too. I don't want her to leave... We're all going to see her off.\"\n\"Take me with you...\"\nSo it was because of the ship repairs? Shia's resentment suddenly evaporated. Come think of it, around this time of the year, the harbor was always at its busiest, of course Grandma would be overwhelmed with work.\nShe regretted it. She shouldn't have picked a fight. But now, what could she do?\n\nThe next morning, Grandma left at dawn again. She was leading the send-off prayers before the ships set sail—the biggest event of the year in town.\nShia followed her in secret. The docks were packed, ships lined in rows, sailors holding their families tight, tears glittering as they said goodbye. Shia's chest tightened.\nShe suddenly realized she had never once really hugged her grandmother. If she couldn't say it out loud, then she would show it. \n\nWhen Grandma finally returned home that night, Shia heard the door creak open. She bolted forward and threw her arms around her grandmother. \n\"I'm sorry, Grandma... I shouldn't have sulked.\"\nShe spilled everything in one breath. And just as she braced for silence, a drop fell onto her hand. \nShe recognized the smell—it was the scent of tears. \n\"Grandma...\"\nThe reply came in an embrace, fierce and wordless, stronger than anything words could hold.",

Diving, sailing, keeping herself busy... Maybe that would wash away the loneliness that clung to her.\n\nAt least the ocean still felt familiar to her. In the dim light beneath the waves, she groped around and searched.\nThe Artifacts granted by wishing at the Monolith came in all shapes and forms, and Shia couldn't even be sure which ones were actually Artifacts, and which were just garbage. She simply kept hauling up whatever she could find, piling it onto her boat until it was filled to the brim. When she returned to port, the client showered her with praises and handed over a generous payment.\nTo cap it all off, she was told that she could keep one Artifact from the dripping wet heap. Shia looked them over and picked a smooth white metal ball.\n\nWould seawater ruin an Artifact?\nShe wasn't sure. She brought it to the Trekker Association headquarters and handed it to Nuz, a tiny girl known for tinkering with strange Artifacts. Nuz's eyes lit up—she'd never seen anything like it—and vanished into her workshop. When Shia finally saw her again, a week had passed. \nThe ball had been polished clean.

Don't tell me I fixed it wrong—\"\nNuz was cut off when something crashed through the glass window. A black rabbit-shaped Artifact shot across the room and landed at Shia's side.\n\"This Artifact...

I'll also pay for you to replace the window class.\"\n\"Uh—r-right, I'll get you the invoice...\"\nNuz thought the girl in front of her was strange.
